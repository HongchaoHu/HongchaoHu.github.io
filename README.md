## Hello World

Hi, I'm Hongchao Hu, but you can call me Jason. I'm glad you are here.  
I am a passionate **Data Analyst** with expertise in data visualization, statistical modeling, and database management. My work bridges technical depth with business strategy, combining strong analytical skills with practical implementation across industries.  <br>
<br>
From leveraging advanced tools like Python (Pandas, SageMath), SQL, Tableau, and Power BI to optimizing feature adoption and driving cost efficiencies, my past working experience and projects reflect a dedication to delivering **data-driven insights** that improve decision-making and strategy.

## Academic Experience

My academic journey began when I moved to Chicago at sixteen to attend Wheaton Academy, an experience that opened the door to studying abroad and broadened my perspective. I later continued my education at the University of California, San Diego, where I earned a **Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science** with a minor in **Business Economics**. At UCSD, I immersed myself in both rigorous technical training and business-focused studies, gaining a strong foundation in programming, database systems, and quantitative analysis while learning how data and technology intersect with economic decision-making. <br>
<br>
Looking ahead, I am excited to pursue a **Master of Science in Data Science** at **Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)** starting in Fall 2025. This next step will allow me to deepen my expertise in analytics, visualization, and predictive modeling while engaging in applied research projects that solve real-world problems. Together, these experiences reflect my commitment to blending strong theoretical foundations with practical, impactful applications of data science in both business and technology. <br>
<br>
Beyond my academic focus on Data Science and Computer Science, I also developed a keen interest in business and marketing, influenced by my family background. My father serves as a state-level manager at the Postal Savings Bank of China (PSBC), one of the country’s largest banks. His leadership inspired me to pursue a minor in Business Economics at UC San Diego and to seek opportunities where I could apply my technical training to business analysis and quantitative decision-making. Ultimately, my career goal is to grow as a data and business analyst and one day step into an executive leadership role—continuing the legacy of hard work and making my father proud. <br>

## Professional Experience

- **Mega InfoTechs** (Jun 2024 – Jan 2025) <br>

At Mega InfoTechs, I worked as both a Data Analyst and Project Coordinator, bridging the gap between business requirements and technical implementation. I gathered and documented BRDs and FSDs to clarify program projections and collaborated with engineering and operations teams to align backlog priorities with merchant growth and launch timelines. On the technical side, I performed exploratory data analysis with Python (Pandas, SageMath) to identify product usage inefficiencies, ultimately reducing operational costs by 2%. I also created cohort analyses and interactive dashboards in Tableau and Jupyter to visualize adoption metrics, while using ARIS to track platform usage and provide roadmap insights. My role combined analytical depth with business process alignment, ensuring projects stayed within scope, on time, and aligned with organizational goals. <br>
<br>

- **Mobalytics** (May 2023 – Sep 2023) <br>

During my internship at Mobalytics, I contributed as both a Data Analyst and Business Analyst Intern in a dynamic gaming analytics environment. I conducted in-depth analysis of customer behavior, retention, and churn metrics using Python and Seaborn in Jupyter Lab, while leveraging Tableau and Power BI for visualization. I also developed forecasting models with Scikit-learn and SciPy to predict market trends and optimize monetization strategies, reducing erroneous deliveries by 50%. Beyond analytics, I documented Epics, Features, and BDD User Stories in JIRA and collaborated across dev, sales, and product teams to manage scope, timelines, and deliverables. This dual focus allowed me to transform complex data into actionable insights while ensuring that projects supported both user experience improvements and business objectives. <br>
<br>

- **American Express** (May 2021 – Aug 2022) <br>

As a Data Analyst and Business Systems Analyst Intern at American Express, I supported global teams in integrating secure systems and designing compliance-focused solutions. I worked with AWS Cognito and SQL to integrate databases across regions, enabling reliable data sharing and validating multi-source flow reports. I collaborated on modeling design and impact analysis for compliance rollouts, contributing to a Waterfall SDLC roadmap for cross-border financial services. Additionally, I performed UAT (User Acceptance Testing) to validate enterprise software solutions and licensing logic, coordinating with data and engineering teams to ensure accuracy and compliance. This role sharpened my ability to blend technical execution with stakeholder communication, driving both performance and regulatory success. <br>
<br>

- **CTA (Central Telecom America)** (Jun 2020 – Sep 2021) <br>

At CTA, I began as a Data Entry Analyst and quickly expanded my responsibilities to include back-end process optimization and performance tracking. I created MySQL-based APIs that improved transaction processing speeds by 13%, while analyzing merchant fulfillment data to identify delivery inefficiencies and model KPIs across seller segments. I also built AWS-based reporting pipelines and structured Excel dashboards to track seller performance, providing early-stage insights for growth strategies. By documenting merchant systems and supporting cross-functional teams, I ensured operational transparency and data-driven decision-making. This experience laid the foundation for my interest in scalable database systems and process automation in real business environments. <br>


## Interests

- One perk of studying at UC San Diego is how close the campus is to the beach. During my time in San Diego, I learned two of my favorite sports: ***Surfing and Scuba Diving***. One of the most relaxing things after all days of coding is to jump into the ocean surf under the sunset or dive with sea lions.

- Music was a major part of my life when growing up. I started playing the violin when I was five and picked up guitar training when I was 14. I was the deputy chief in my high school Wheaton Academy orchestra, and it helped me accumulate tons of experience in classical music theory and leadership skills.

- I am also a big hardcore gamer. I like how video games can help me construct my strategic thinking and skills growth. I enjoy the process of ranking up and getting to know the unique mechanism of each video game. My passion for competitive gaming pushed me to pursue working experience in Mobalytics to dive deep into the gaming industry.
