## Academic Experience

I went to Chicago when I was 16 for high school. I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of California San Diego pursuing a bachelor's degree in **Mathematics and Computer Science**. I have a great interest in Data Science and Software Engineering and have developed advanced coding experience in Object-oriented Programming, Database Management, and Operation System Design. <br>
<br>
Besides my main focus on Math and Computer Science, I also decided to pursue Business Economics as my minor study at UC San Diego. With the development of renovating data and computer technologies, I also have a keen interest in deploying my professional training and skills in the field of Business Analysis and Quantitative Analysis. <br>

## Professional Experience

- [Mobalytics](https://mobalytics.gg/) (June 2023 - August 2023) <br>

During my summer internship at Mobalytics, a renowned analytics platform catering to video game enthusiasts, I learned much from a meticulous data analyst to an innovative web developer. My primary responsibilities revolved around utilizing Python and R for rigorous data cleaning and validation, ensuring the platform provided players with dependable performance analysis. I took the helm in overseeing the complete lifecycle of data - from uploading to quality checks. Leveraging MySQL, I empowered users by facilitating the creation of tailored reports and offering insightful, actionable recommendations. Occasionally, I also collaborated with the front-end team to optimize the web interface to make it easier for client players to retrieve data visually and analyze reports. Collaborative at my core, I frequently engaged with cross-functional teams, analyzing challenges and crafting effective solutions to enhance the user experience. <br>

- [China Telecommunications Corporation](https://www.189.cn/) (June 2020 - August 2020) <br>

As a Network System Administrator Assistant. My primary goal at CTC was codesign a data network that enables an increase in cloud data center demands, accomplished by enhancing data processing efficiency by a substantial 28% to 35%. This feat was realized through our team's innovative design and implementation of a neural network using PyTorch. Additionally, I was entrusted with gathering, structuring, and critically analyzing vast amounts of server information in the terminal database system. Recognizing the burgeoning needs of emerging businesses, I crafted an adaptive database tailored for small to medium online ventures using the versatile combination of Node.js and MongoDB. Beyond these technical contributions, I delved deep into comprehensive research, lending my expertise to six startup projects, each showcasing the potential to revolutionize their respective industries. <br>

## Interests

- One perk of studying at UC San Diego is how close the campus is to the beach. During my time in San Diego, I learned two of my favorite sports: ***Surfing and Scuba Diving***. One of the most relaxing things after all days of coding is to jump into the ocean surf under the sunset or dive with sea lions.
  
- Music was a major part of my life when growing up. I started playing the violin when I was five and picked up guitar training when I was 14. I was the deputy chief in my high school Wheaton Academy orchestra, and it helped me accumulate tons of experience in classical music theory and leadership skills.

- I am also a big hardcore gamer. I like how video games can help me construct my strategic thinking and skills growth. I enjoy the process of ranking up and getting to know the unique mechanism of each video game. My passion for competitive gaming pushed me to pursue working experience in Mobalytics to dive deep into the gaming industry.
