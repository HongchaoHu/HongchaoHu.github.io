Database Design and Implement


# **Secure Real-Time Data Visualization Platform**

The digital age we inhabit sees an ever-growing dependency on data, thereby amplifying the urgency of data security. Journey with me through this compelling project where I amalgamate the robustness of CryptoJS encryption with a NoSQL database, specifically MongoDB, to encrypt and securely store JSON data.

## 1. **Database Creation and Structuring**
The foundation of the project is a robust **MySQL** database, structured to store and manage handwritten images of Chinese Pinyin. Within the database, a dedicated table is provisioned, where each record consists of a unique identifier (like `table_id`) and its corresponding image data, stored in **BLOB** format. Efficiently indexed and organized, this setup ensures that images can be swiftly retrieved and processed, laying the groundwork for the successive machine learning pipeline.

## 2. **JSON Data Retrieval and Encryption**
With Python's `PyMongo` library, we source the data destined for encryption. The omnipotent **CryptoJS** library then steps in to encrypt each fragment of JSON data prior to its archival. The nested nature of JSON mandates a profound traversal and encryption of every embedded object or array, ensuring every last bit of data is securely encrypted. This guarantees that even in the unfortunate event of unauthorized database access, the data remains inscrutable.

```Python
# Encrypt data with AES-CBC and return ciphertext and HMAC
# Import Crypto Modules...
def encrypt_data(data, key):
    hmac_key = key[:16]  # First half of the key for HMAC
    enc_key = key[16:]  # Second half of the key for encryption
    
    iv = get_random_bytes(16)
    cipher = AES.new(enc_key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
    encrypted = cipher.encrypt(pad(data.encode(), 16))
    
    # Calculate HMAC for encrypted data and append it
    hmac = HMAC.new(hmac_key, encrypted, digestmod=SHA256).digest()
    return base64.b64encode(iv + encrypted + hmac)
```

## 3. **Data Decryption and Utilization**
Fetching encrypted data for use is just one part of the challenge; decrypting it for meaningful interpretation is the climax. Again, the unique nature of JSON structures requires recursive decryption to ensure all nested data is deciphered accurately.

## 4. **Results and Applications**
The encrypted data residing in MongoDB offers an enhanced layer of security against potential data breaches or unauthorized access. However, it's essential to securely manage and store the encryption keys. Lose the key, and the data remains an enigma forever.
